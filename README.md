                Chakkilidurg Hill is one of the three prominent hillocks that constitute the historic Gingee Fort in Tamil Nadu. 
                The fort atop this hill is also known as Chamar Tikri or Chakkiliya Durg, which translates to "Fort of the Cobblers," 
                possibly indicating its association with royal saddlers and military shoemakers during its active period . The hill 
                features the Venkataramana Temple at its base, a significant Vijayanagara-era structure renowned for its architectural 
                beauty and intricate carvings . While much of the fortification has succumbed to time, the hill remains a challenging 
                trek for visitors, offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. Today, Chakkilidurg Hill stands as a testament 
                to the region's rich military and cultural heritage.
