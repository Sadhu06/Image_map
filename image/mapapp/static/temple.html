                The Sri Veera Anjaneyar Temple is located within the historic Gingee Fort in Tamil Nadu. This ancient temple 
                features a bas-relief of Lord Hanuman carved into a boulder, dating back to the Vijayanagara Nayaka period. 
                The temple's architecture includes intricately carved pillars depicting scenes from Vishnu mythology, such 
                as Lakshmi Narasimha and Anjaneya. Devotees visit the temple to seek blessings for various aspects of life, 
                including marriage and family well-being. The temple is an integral part of the Gingee Fort complex, reflecting 
                the rich cultural heritage of the region.
